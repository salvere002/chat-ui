# State Management Improvements

This document outlines the recent state management improvements in the Chat UI application.

## Overview of Changes

1. **Migrated from React Context to Zustand**
   - Replaced Context API with Zustand for more efficient state management
   - Improved performance by avoiding unnecessary re-renders
   - Simplified component access to global state

2. **Better Separation of Concerns**
   - Created specialized stores for different domains:
     - `chatStore`: Manages chat sessions, messages and related operations
     - `themeStore`: Handles theme preferences and switching
     - `toastStore`: Manages toast notifications
     - `agentStore`: Controls agent selection and configuration

3. **TypeScript Interface Improvements**
   - Added proper TypeScript interfaces for all state objects in `src/types/store.ts`
   - Improved type safety throughout the application
   - Better IDE autocompletion and error catching

4. **Centralized State Logic**
   - State manipulation logic moved from components to store implementation
   - Components only consume state and trigger actions
   - Easier to debug and reason about state changes

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Better State Persistence**
   - State is maintained outside the React component tree
   - Easier to persist state to localStorage or other storage mechanisms
   - State remains consistent across route changes

2. **Simpler Component Testing**
   - Components don't need to be wrapped in provider components for testing
   - Easier to mock state in unit tests
   - More predictable component behavior

3. **Improved Developer Experience**
   - Direct access to state via hooks without deep prop drilling
   - Simplified component implementation
   - More explicit data flow

## Using the Stores

Example of how to use a store in a component:

```tsx
import { useChatStore, useThemeStore } from '../stores';

function MyComponent() {
  // Use the chat store
  const { chatSessions, addMessageToChat } = useChatStore();
  
  // Use the theme store
  const { theme, toggleTheme } = useThemeStore();
  
  return (
    <div className={`container ${theme}-theme`}>
      {/* Component implementation */}
    </div>
  );
}
```
